            Lighting ghee lamps at the ancient temple atop the historically recorded Songtsan Gambo’s tomb is the first thing for Tenzin to do in the morning. <br>
            After that, he cleans and picks up trash around tombs, burns incense and prepares holy water in the temple, chants his sutras, then comes the most challenging duty for him: showing visitors around the temple. Coming to work in the valley in 2014, Tenzin is trying hard to learn the history of the tombs and pass it on to visitors from around the world, while overcoming his introverted nature.

                Born in 1990, and part of a generation defined by a society with an unstable working attitude, Tenzin was described by his father as simple-minded. Before coming to guard the tombs, Tenzin was working in a construction site and ended up performing the same amount of work as five people. He was known to devote himself to whatever he was doing without complaining.

            Worried about his health, Tenzin’s father had a long talk with him and decided the quiet temple of the Tibetan king tombs is the place which suited his personality and it would give him a chance to get close to what he loved from childhood.
            <br><br>
            “I really like this place and barely think of going back home. My parents would feel happy for me if I do my job well here. ” Tenzin soon adapted to the simple life in the temple and set up his mind to guard the tombs in the valley for the rest of his life.

Then, it was only me.” 68-year-old Jampa Choesang was the cook in the temple before taking over guard duty. “Tenzin has passed through the month-long assessment from local officials and proved himself a very responsible young man.”

            The two are in charge of managing the temple above Songtsan Gambo’s tomb and guarding the other Tibetan Kings’ tombs. They take turns guarding the entire area at least ten times a month.
