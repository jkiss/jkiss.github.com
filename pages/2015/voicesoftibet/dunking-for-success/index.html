            The 14 members of the club make up Tibet’s first professional basketball team. Unlike most players, they have been trained in both low and extremely high altitudes, thus having a distinct advantage on the home field. That strength was proven in their first match and won against the PLA Nanjing Military Region team.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But playing so high up comes at a cost. Just 20 minutes into the game and both teams needed to frequently change players. They’re forced to use oxygen bottles to keep up the pace.

                “The most important thing for the players was to adapt to the environment,” Liu Tie, coach of the Lhasa club said. With such tough conditions, the team trained only eight hours a day, less than most professional teams, and spent the rest of the time watching recorded matches.

                As one of only two Tibetans in the team, Rinchen Choedak has gained strong support from local viewers. Although lacking professional experience, Rinchen was the most popular player in amateur basketball team Snowland Brothers, which was famous in Tibetan area.

            At 6.1 feet, 27-year-old Rinchen is shorter than most of his teammates--a physical challenge he must work hard to overcome. “I’m currently a bench player in the team, but I'll try my best.”

                Trained from a young age at a sports school in his hometown Qamdo prefecture, Sichuan Province, Rinchen says basketball is like the other half of himself. “I spent most of my childhood in the game and made many friends through the sport.” After majoring in basketball at Beijing Sport University, Rinchen followed the mainstream choice of many young Tibetans——becoming a public servant.

            But when the Lhasa Sukhavati Basketball Club began recruitment in January, 2015, Rinchen seized the opportunity to follow his dream. “My family was not very approving of my choice, as they think basketball is a profession for young people,” he says. “But I thought it might be my last chance to get close to the sport.”

            According to Rinchen, sports events are strongly welcomed by locals in the area where the autonomous region meets Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. And if the swarms of people watching the latest NBL game say anything, the same is very much true in Lhasa. Still, few young people there make sports a lifestyle choice.

                “Lhasa lacks public basketball courts and athletic fields, so even if people want to play and exercise, they don’t have many places to go, ” Rinchen explained. “Young people in Lhasa tend to go to bars (to relax) rather than play basketball.”

            Basketball is not the only sport lacking facilities in the city. There remain few courts, pools or fields for leisure activities in Tibet. Yet as businesses start to creep in, that may soon change.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            One company, started by a college student named Norbu, recently built a scaled-down five-player football court in the city. “It is really hard to find a place to play the normal 11-player football in here,” he explains, adding that they hope to build more sports facilities, such as basketball courts, badminton courts, tennis courts and swimming pools.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            As more people look to Tibet for commercial opportunities, perhaps over time, a sports industry may develop in one of the unlikeliest and toughest regions in the world, and young people like Rinchen may see others enjoy his passion.
