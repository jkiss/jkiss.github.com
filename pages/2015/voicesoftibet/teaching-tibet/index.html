                It is this fun and creative style of teaching that is the hallmark of his Dreamer education center in Lhasa, the capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
            </p>
            <p>
                After studying and working in other parts of China, Norbu, 30, returned to Lhasa and set up Dreamer in 2013, with the aim of ensuring that his fellow Tibetans can thrive in the competitive, modern-day job market.

            “It s like back in the 80s, when in other parts of China, lots of people quit their jobs. People thought they were nuts. But after a decade or two, those crazy ones were the people who were bringing about revolutionary changes in China. Now it’s our turn. We are the generation to make Tibet a better place. ” —— Norbu Dradul

        <h2>DREAMER TEACHING</h2>
        <div class="m-left">
            <p>
                While most Chinese parents look at extra-curricular activities as value-adds to formal classes and grades, the Dreamer center is hoping to make alternative education a mainstream among Tibetans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “In China, parents believe they know what’s best for their children, even though they don’t know what’s best for themselves,” Norbu says, touching upon Chinese parents’ obsession with grades.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At Dreamer, however, he wants students to explore their potential as they see it best. “I really want everybody here to think about their dreams - why they are here; what they want to do,” Norbu tells us, leaning back on a chair.

                But such exploration necessitates smaller class sizes, where students can enjoy individual attention and even engage in designing and improving the teaching methodology. For instance, students at Dreamer are encouraged to name the exercises that they participate in and their achievements are recognized via “dream dollars.”

                The aim, Norbu explains, is to shift from the rigid, traditional teaching methodology to a more open and organic learning process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “If they (students) are not happy with the class they take, they are encouraged to talk to their parents and change to something else. Kids may be more talented if you let them do what they want,” he says.

            But while in one way Norbu is looking to break from the past, in another, he is keen to preserve it. For example, cultural site visits are a key component of the education at Dreamer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “When people know about themselves, they have more confidence to know the outside world better,” says Norbu, outlining the philosophy behind the emphasis on cultural education.

            Despite his Tibetan heritage, Norbu never really studied in Tibet. In fact, much of his schooling took place in Shanghai, Tianjin and Xi’an. The diverse experiences resulted in him developing a deep understanding of education in China.

            <br>

                Slowly but surely moving ahead on the path to becoming an educationist, Norbu shifted to Beijing to train at the drama education center.

                “Having all these experience as dots connected in my mind, I decided that I should go back to Tibet. I wanted to build my own place, my own school,” he says, explaining how he ended up founding Dreamer.
