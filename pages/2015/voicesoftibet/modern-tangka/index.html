                On the roof of a maisonette beside the river in Lhasa, Tenzin Phuntsok, head of the Khatot Art Center, is leading a discussion on the digital platforms that can be used to preserve and promote the art of the Tangka.

            <p>
                There is an air of excitement among the young audience as he explains his plan to organize online to offline lectures, introduce educational approaches and build a bridge between artists and learners.

            <br>
            <p>
                Just below where the meeting is being held is the Tanba Ramdan Tangka Arts School, which offers free education to Tibetan students keen on learning traditional Buddhist painting craft.

                Over the years, with increasing public interest in the art form and support from the government, Tangka has transformed from a purely religious art form to one that has a wider audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not only are people keen to purchase Tangka artworks but many have traveled to Tibet to learn the craft. However, growing consumer demand has also presented challenges for traditional artists.

            For instance, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish a boutique Tangka painting from the large amount of Tangka handiworks available in the market.

        <br>
        <p>
            Moreover, Phuntsok’s approach of ensuring greater commercial viability for the art form and training all those interested has led to some tension with old school values. However, building a platform for the mysterious art in digital era could be the middle ground that both sides could find palatable.

        <h2>CULTIVATION IS THE KEY</h2>
        <p class="txt1">
            Traditionally, the art of Tangka was more like a family inheritance, passed down from one generation to another. Even within that, it was usually the male members of the family who were trained. That, over time, led to the number of artists shrinking,

                threatening the future of the art form. In fact, at one point of time in the 1980s, there were only 20 Tangka artists left in Lhasa.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As one of the few distinguished Tangka artists, Tanba Ramdan, Phuntsok’ s father decided to break the rule and started to take in students from broader society. Now 30 years later, the family workshop has grown into a professional institution, and has been granted the tag of an intangible cultural heritage. For his efforts, 74-year-old Tanba Ramdan has been hailed as a modern master, teaching both at his own school and in the University of Tibet.

            Growing up in a family of Tangka artists, Phuntsok naturally took to painting from childhood, winning awards in all sorts of painting competitions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “My father has never pushed me to learn Tangka painting, but it was part of my everyday life,” he recollects. However, it was not until he was 13-year-old that he began to formally learn Tangka painting. “My interest towards the art just grew together with me,” he says.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As he grew older, Phuntsok delved deeper into fine arts, studying contemporary art and absorbing the different forms of painting. His efforts, he says, expanded his horizons and also deepened his understanding of Tangka. Eventually, he took a teaching position at the University of Tibet, educating students in the art of the Tangka.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It was then that he began to not only create his own art but also began to acquire theoretical knowledge as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “I began to realize that the key of inheritance is cultivation,” says Phuntsok. In 2013, he took over the Tanba Ramdan Tangka Arts School from his father, and now after establishing the Khatot Art Center, he living his dream.
        </p>
        <br>

            “The inheritance of Tangka is my mission and responsibility; I will drive my whole life into it,” he says.

            It took Phuntsok 40 minutes to answer a question about the meaning of Tibet to him. Still, he was dissatisfied with his answer. He sent a message to our reporter later, and explained, “I have never thought of the question of what Tibet means to me. It took me a while to think about who I am. Now I found the word home, say it culture inheritance, Buddhism belief or the grace of upbringing, Tibet is my home.”
